# Biological-Modeling-of-Neural-Network-Bio-465
This repository contains the two mini-projects of the course Bio-465 at epfl during the spring semester 2020.

## Project 1
This project aims to discover the behaviour of integrate and fire models.
* Quadratic I&F : Quadratic integrate and  fire models
* Exponential I&F : Exponential integrate and fire models
* Adex : Adaptative exponential integrate and fire models
